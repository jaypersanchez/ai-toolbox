# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Train ChatGpt with customized data model

To train a chatbot with your own data model using ChatGPT, you can follow these general steps:

Collect and preprocess your data: The first step is to gather the data you want to use to train your chatbot. This can include text data from chat logs, customer support conversations, or any other relevant sources. Once you have your data, you will need to preprocess it by cleaning, normalizing, and tokenizing it to prepare it for training.

Fine-tune the pre-trained model: Once you have preprocessed your data, you can fine-tune a pre-trained ChatGPT model using your own data. Fine-tuning involves retraining the model on your specific data to adapt it to your use case. You can use the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained ChatGPT model and fine-tune it on your own data.

Evaluate and improve your model: After you have fine-tuned your model, you will need to evaluate its performance on a test set of data. You can use metrics like perplexity, accuracy, and F1 score to measure the quality of your model's responses. If your model is not performing well, you can iterate on your data preprocessing or adjust the hyperparameters of the model.

Deploy your chatbot: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your chatbot, you can deploy it in your application or website. You can use a framework like Flask or Django to build a web interface that interacts with your chatbot model.

It's important to note that training a high-quality chatbot requires a large amount of data and computing resources. You may need to use cloud-based GPU instances or other high-performance computing resources to train your model effectively. Additionally, you may need to experiment with different hyperparameters, learning rates, and other settings to optimize your model's performance.
